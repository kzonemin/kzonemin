## Projects
I have worked on a variety of projects, including those involving data analysis, machine learning, and voice pathology detection. Below is a description of one of my completed projects:

### **Vocal Pathology Detection Project**
This dataset contains data from 500 individuals, divided into 250 males and females (125 healthy voices and 125 unhealthy voices). The individuals are in the age range of 20-50. The goal of the project is to explore feature extraction techniques and classification models to detect vocal pathologies based on the available data.
